12/4/2019 ESlint-My New Best Friend

Summary: ESlint will find and fix things in your JavaScript Code. I knew that style and consistency are important in coding, however,
today I learned that there are actual style guides at tech companies and if you are going to be a decent developer you 
better pay attention to style.

Skills: Used the command line to install EsLint and configure Eslint according to your style.
