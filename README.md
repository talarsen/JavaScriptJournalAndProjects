# myJournalToBecomingAJavaScriptProgrammer
This is my daily journal of what I am learning on my JavaScript programming journey. It will be useful for me to keep track of what I am learning.  Also, it will show prospective employers that I have knowledge and experience with GitHib and JavaScript.


#12/4/2019 ESlint-My New Best Friend

Summary: ESlint will find and fix things in your JavaScript Code. I knew that style and consistency are important in coding, however,
today I learned that there are actual style guides at tech companies and if you are going to be a decent developer you 
better pay attention to style.

Skills: Used the command line to install EsLint and configure Eslint according to your style. 


2/24/20 Back in the Ringâ€¦Round??
I am excited to hop back in the ring of programming. I've been away for awhile...side tracked on a not yet successful job search. Luckily, I have substitute teaching as a side hustle.  I am excited to get back in the ring and my goal is to code every day.  All self-taught developers say that it is essential to code every day and when the road gets rough don't spend hours on the problem.  Go do something else productive until you are ready to solve the code challenge. So I will code every day. 

Skills: Learned about "Fetching Data"...APIS. I built a small JS function to interact with NASA's Mars Insight API to get the current weather on Elysium Planitia( a broad plain on Mars that strattles the equator)  where Insight is located. 


Also, Today I started a project building a cool JS etch-a-sketch. 
Skills: Turning API data into JSON format using a JSON Chrome Extension. Writing a script that displays the API data in the Chrome console.
